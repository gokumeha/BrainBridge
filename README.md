## 🧠 System Overview

BrainBridge follows a modular architecture where each component (Tutor, Quiz, Flashcards, Timer, Analytics) operates independently while sharing global state through **React Context API**.

```
User → Frontend (React)
     → Firebase Auth (Login/Signup)
     → Gemini AI (Response & Quiz Generation)
     → Firestore (Data Storage & Progress Tracking)
     → Analytics Dashboard (Visual Feedback)
```

This ensures seamless real-time updates, persistent state, and a smooth user experience.
